TZ, 2023

This app shows the weather on a specific city in the world, chosen by the user.

There are two options to use the app:
1. Using the gui, by running the file gui.py using python
2. Using the docker file, running the docker is done by:
    a. building the docker: docker build -t weatherapp
    b. running it interactively from the terminal: run -ti weatherapp

To use the app, you have to use an API key provided by www.openweathermap.org
After a quick sign-up proccess, you can get a free API key code, similar to the one provided in the comment Weatherinfo.py
The API key provided in the comment does not work, it was used only for testing.
